			<p>The Muslim Students’ association is University of Carleton’s largest student club. For this project, I worked closely with the club’s president and project lead as I rebranded the association's identity. The rebrand included creating a new site, launching a mini merchandise store, designing membership cards and several other props.</p>

	   		<p>Conceptualizing the logo revolved around meeting three client requirements: to represent a welcoming atmosphere, to include an element of Islamic art as well as an element unique of Carleton University.</p>
