		<h3>Brand Identity • Website design</h3>

		<p>The Muslim Students’ association is University of Carleton’s largest student club. For this project, I worked closely with the club’s president and project lead as I was in charge of rebranding the club’s identity. The rebrand included creating a new site, launching a merchandise store, designing membership cards and several other props.</p>

    	<p>Conceptualizing the logo revolved around meeting three client requirements: to represent a welcoming atmosphere, to include an element of Islamic art as well as an element unique of Carleton University.</p>
